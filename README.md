# Assingment-5
Firstly, I got a dataset of online sales from Kaggle. Then, I splitted the dataset into two, but making sure column name,"index" remain same.
Afterthat, imported the required libraries in python and load the dataset.
Then, checked the dataset if it has any null values and drop that columns using dropna() function.
Finally, merged two datasets into one using merge() function of python and used "os='index'" function to merge two data by making index column as common.
