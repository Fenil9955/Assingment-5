First of all, I checked the dataset to see if it was clean or not. But it was clean.
In both datasets, I have one column same, named "index".
Then it creates a problem while merging the dataset.
I was trying to merge them with the index column but, it was giving me some syntax errors.
Then got some help from Google and found it that, to merge two datasets with one column same, we have to use "on=" function.
Finally, typed in "on = 'index'" to join two datasets.
