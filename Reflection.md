One of the major hurdles I encountered was ensuring data integrity and cleanliness. 
Dealing with missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies demanded meticulous attention and a systematic approach to data preprocessing.
This phase emphasized the significance of data preparation as a foundation for accurate analysis.

The process of designing and implementing the JOIN and aggregation operations presented another notable challenge. 
While these operations are fundamental, I discovered that careful selection of attributes for JOIN and appropriate aggregation measures requires 
a comprehensive understanding of the data and its context. 
This insight underscored the importance of thorough data exploration and domain knowledge in shaping effective transformations.

Reflecting on this project, I recognize certain aspects that I would approach differently in the future. 
Primarily, I would allocate more time upfront for thorough data exploration before diving into transformations. 
By better understanding the datasets and their nuances, 
I believe I could make more informed decisions regarding the specific JOIN and aggregation strategies that would yield the most insightful outcomes.

In conclusion, this project has been an invaluable learning experience that has significantly enhanced my proficiency in data manipulation, 
transformation, and the practical implementation of database operations using Python.
