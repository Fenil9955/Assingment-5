First of all, I checked the dataset to see if it was clean or not. But it was clean.
In both datasets, I have one column same, named "index".
Then it creates a problem while merging the dataset.
I was trying to merge them with index column but, it was giving me some syntax error.
Then got some help frm Google and found it that, to merge two dataset with one column as same, we have to use "on=" function.
Finally, typed in "on = 'index'" to join two datasets.
